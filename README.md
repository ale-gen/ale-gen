# üë©‚Äçüíª About me

My name is Aleksandra Generowicz and I am a third year student of Applied Computer Science at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology. Despite some experience with programming languages like Python or Java, I have started learning Swift to develop my own applications on IOS. Quickly I understood, that was it. Currently, I constantly broaden my knowledge to build more and more incredible apps with beautiful design!
